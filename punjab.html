            Punjab is a state in northwest region of India and is one of the most prosperous states. The name Punjab is
            made of two words Punj (Five) + Aab (Water) i.e. land of five rivers. These five rivers of Punjab are
            Sutlej, Beas, Ravi, Chenab, and Jhelum. Only Sutlej, Ravi and Beas rivers flow in today's Punjab. It was
            created
            in 1947, when the partition of India split the former Raj province of Punjab between India and Pakistan. The
            mostly Muslim western part of the province became Pakistan's Punjab Province; the mostly Sikh eastern part
            became India's Punjab state.<br> <br>
