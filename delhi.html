    <div class="about dl">
        <p>Delhi, officially the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, is a city and a union territory of India
            containing New Delhi, the capital of India. Lying on both sides of the Yamuna river, but chiefly to the
            west, or
            beyond its right bank, Delhi shares borders with the state of Uttar Pradesh in the east and with the state
            of
            Haryana in the remaining directions. Delhi became a union territory on 1 November 1956 and the NCT in 1995.
            The NCT covers an area of 1,484 square kilometres (573 sq mi). According to the 2011 census, Delhi's city
            proper population was over 11 million, while the NCT's population was about 16.8 million. <br><br>

            Some of the most popular tourist destinations in Delhi include: <br>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Temple">The Lotus Temple</a>, located in Delhi, India, is a
                Bahá'í House of Worship that was
                dedicated in December 1986, costing $10 million. Notable for its flowerlike shape, it has become a
                prominent attraction in the city. <br> <br></li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Gate">India Gate</a> ,at the centre of New Delhi stands the
                42 m high India Gate, an "Arc-de-Triomphe" like
                archway in the middle of a crossroad. Almost similar to its French counterpart, it commemorates the
                70,000 Indian soldiers who lost their lives fighting for the British Army during the World War I. <br>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humayun%27s_Tomb">The tomb of Humayun</a>, second Mughal Emperor
                of India, was built by his widow, Biga Begum
                (Hajji Begum), in 1569-70, 14 years after his death, at a cost of 1.5 million rupees. The architect was
                Mirak Mirza Ghiyath. It was later used for the burial of various members of the ruling family and
                contains some 150 graves. <br><br></li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashtrapati_Bhavan">The Rashtrapati Bhavan</a> in New Delhi is
                the official residence of the Honorable President of
                India. Also known as the President House or Presidential Residence, this building is among the
                grandest and largest residences designed for a Head of State around the world. <br> <br></li>
            <li><a href="#">Qutub Minar</a>built of red and buff sandstone and eloquently carved with inscriptional
                bands, the Qutb
                Minar is the tallest masonry tower in India, measuring 72.5 metres high, with projecting balconies for
                calling all Muadhdhin to prayer. An iron pillar in the courtyard gave the mosque a unique Indian
                aesthetic. <br> <br></li>
